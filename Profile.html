          <p><strong>The first thing to keep in mind is that your About Us page is not just about you – <br>it’s about what you can do for potential customers, and why you should be the one to do it.<br> Therefore, you’ll want to make sure you provide some background on both your products and your team. <br>You’ll also want to emphasize the core values that make your company unique. </strong></p>
          <p>Writing about your products or services is simple. If you’ve created your ecommerce business in response to a gap in the market or a pain point that you think people can relate to, then tell that story! People will be curious about the origins behind your ideas.

            Writing about your team means showing customers that there are real, relatable people bringing your business to life. This is your chance to build likeability and trust, both of which go a long way in attracting new customers and retaining older ones. 
            
            Writing about your core values will show customers what your ecommerce business is all about. You can include these as a concise mission statement on your About Us page, and you can also use your values as a guide to organizing the rest of your content with a cohesive tone of voice.
